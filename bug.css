The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when used with percentages and other units if the order of operations is not carefully considered.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the containing element's width is not precisely known at the time of calculation. This can lead to unexpected layout issues.
