To correct the calculation, ensure that you're ordering the elements correctly within the `calc()` function.  For example:

Instead of:
```css
width: calc(50% - 10px);
```
Which subtracts 10px from 50% of the *final* width (leading to inaccuracies), use:
```css
width: calc(50% - 10px);
/* OR */
width: calc( (100% - 20px) / 2 ); /* Example of another problematic usage*/
/*Corrected*/
width: calc(100% - 20px); /*Corrected*/

```
The corrected version will produce more reliable and predictable results.
